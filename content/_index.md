## Welcome to qm.md!

We want to compile tutorials and other resources on how to run QM/MM MD simulations with different computational set-ups. No matter what your background or set-up is, feel free to [contact me](https://pult.ar) or check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/pultar/qm.md) if you want to contribute in any way.
